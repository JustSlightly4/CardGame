string gamerules = "Game Rules:"
		"\n\n1: Each player gets a user defined amount of cards referred to as a Deck."
		"\n\n2: Before play begins, each Deck is shuffled and hidden from the player."
		"\n\n3: Each player then takes the first and last Card from their Deck and puts "
			"those cards into play. The players first Card is considered their main Card "
			"and the players last Card is considered their support Card."
		"\n\n4: A players main Card is always the Card that is taking damage or debuffs from "
			"the opponent. The support Card can not be targeted by the opponent."
		"\n\n5: A randomly selected player goes first and has the "
			"option to attack, cast a spell, swap their main Card out for their support Card, charge up "
			"their Card, use their flask, or print the gamerules."
		"\n\n6: If a Card's health or power falls below one, the round is ended and the "
			"winning player recieves a point. Both main cards currently in play are then "
			"discarded and each player's next Card is played as their main. All support cards remain in "
			"play upon a rounds end. The player who lost the last round gets to go first on the next round."
		"\n\n7: Upon attacking, the Card in play has a 5% chance to either land a "
			"critical hit for 20% more damage or miss their attack entirely. A cards base damage is always that "
			"cards amount of physical power."
		"\n\n8: Upon casting a spell, the Card in play will cast their chosen spell at the opponent for various effects. "
			"In general, the spells power will be a random value between one and the cards magical power."
		"\n\n9: Upon swapping, the player swaps their main Card out for their support Card/ "
			"Swapping can only be done twice per round and can not be "
			"done on the last round of the game."
		"\n\n10: Upon charging up, the players Card receives an increase to their health and "
			"power. If a Card powers up twice, the Card uses their special ability."
		"\n\n11: Upon using the flask, the players Card will be fully healed. The "
			"flask does not use up the players turn and they may take another action. "
			"However, the flask may only be used twice per game."
		"\n\n12: Upon printing the gamerules, the gamerules will be displayed on screen. "
			"Printing the gamerules does not use up the players turn and they may take "
			"another action.";

		"\n\n-Faithful: Increases users critical hit chance."

		"\n\n-Accurate: Increases the users critical hit chance and decreases the users miss chance."
		"\n\n-Inner Gate: The user can only either critical hit or miss an attack."
		"\n\n-Necromancy: Revives the most powerful fallen Card in the users Deck and puts that Card into play. If there are no fallen cards in the users Deck then the user gains power instead."
		"\n\n-Divine Help: The gods strike the users opponent."
		"\n\n-Nullify: If the opponent has not used their ability yet, the user will prevent the opponent from ever using their ability. Otherwise, the user will attempt to reverse the oppponents ability."
		"\n\n-Made in Heaven: The user will reset the opponents charge back to zero. Does not affect already used abilities."
		"\n\n-Chaos: The user will use a random ability."
		"\n\n-Strategic Fire: The user will pick an ability depending on various game factors."
		"\n\n\nCard Spells:"
		"\n\n-Force: Attack the opponent for a random value between one and the users magical power"
		"\n\n-Drain: Attacks the opponent power for a random value between one and the users magical power divided by two"
